# SEG2105-Project
## Deliverable 1
### Student Course Booking App

This application is written in Java and built using Android Studio

In this deliverable, we implemented the user account management component and the admin
functionality.

The admin functionality includes creating, editing, and deleting courses. The admins are able to create
a course by entering both a course code and a course name. The admin can also edit both the course code
and course name of existing courses. These courses can later be seen by instructors and students in later
deliverables. If desired, the admin is able to delete a course entirely. The admin is able to delete both instructor and student user accounts.

To simplify the process, there is a single pre-created admin account. One can use the username
admin and the password admin123. You should be able to create as many instructor and student accounts
as desired.
