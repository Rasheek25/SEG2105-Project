## Deliverable 2
### Student Course Booking App

This application is written in Java and built using Android Studio.

In this deliverable, we implemented the instructor functionality.

The instructor user functionality includes viewing all courses and searching for specific ones. The
instructor is able to search using the course code and course name.

If a course has no assigned instructor, the user may assign themselves to be the instructor of that course.
If the course already has an instructor, the user is unable to assign themselves as instructor. For courses
that they are instructing, the user can add and edit the course days, course hours, course description, and
course student capacity. The instructor user can also un-assign themselves from a course. This removes the instructor while also
removing any specified course days, hours, description, and student capacity.
